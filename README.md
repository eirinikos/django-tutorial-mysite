# Greetings, mate.

Not much to see here - just a repo with commits that document the steps I'm taking with my first foray in [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). This is an effort to familiarize myself with standard Django lingo and with the Django paradigm.

Read my commit history to get an understanding of the material that's covered in each part of [this Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial01/).
