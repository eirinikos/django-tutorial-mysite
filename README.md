#Greetings, mate.

Not much to see here - just a repo with commits that document the steps I'm taking with my first foray in Django.

Read my commit history to get an understanding of the material that's covered in each part of [this Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial01/).
